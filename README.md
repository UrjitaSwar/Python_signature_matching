# Signature-Matching
This Application is used to detect the similarity of two signatures.

This Application can help one mathematically evaluate the similarity of two signatures. 
By capturing or uploading the picture of both signatures, the comparison then can be made.
Both the images will be displayed on the screen that are being compared.
The popup will show the percentage match of the signatures.
The signatures are then compared using structural_similarity in skimage.metrics package.
